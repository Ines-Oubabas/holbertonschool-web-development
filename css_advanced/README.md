# Smile School - Advanced CSS Project

Welcome to the Smile School project! 🎉

This project is a continuation of the `HTML, advanced` project. The goal here is to apply CSS styles to match a professional web design layout provided via Figma.

## 📚 Project Description

The website you're building presents a fictional platform called Smile School. It includes:

- A header and banner section
- A testimonial quote
- A list of video tutorials
- A membership promotion section
- A FAQ section
- A footer

All these sections are implemented in pure HTML and styled using pure CSS — no JavaScript, frameworks, or external libraries (like Bootstrap) are used.

## 📁 Files

- `index.html`: The HTML structure of the webpage (provided from the previous project)
- `styles.css`: The CSS file where all styling is implemented
- `README.md`: This documentation file

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

- CSS specificity
- Inline and external styles
- Box model
- Flexbox
- Typography and fonts
- Responsive layout
- Semantic HTML

## 🛠 How to Run
